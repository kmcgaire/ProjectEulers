README:

This shows my progress since starting Project Euler in late March 2013.

I wanted to learn programming, and without having taken any programming courses I chose this as my platform. I had brief experience with Python and used this as the language I would solve the problems in.

This repository shows the progress of my learning from day one until now. At the start, the code is ugly,the solutions brute force in nature, and inefficient algorithms. Over the course of these problems I decided to develop a file Euler.py that contains alot of the functions I've had to create multiple times to be used in the future.

This repository is for work pre Sept 2013, all self taught.
See repository ProjectEuler2 for work post Sept 2013
